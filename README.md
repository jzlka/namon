Multiplatform C++ tool which captures network traffic into pcap-ng file and extends it with application tags. 
The application tag consists of recognized application and its socket records. The socket record uniquely identifies group of packets which belong to one applications socket.  
Application tags are appended to the end of the capture pcap-ng file as one Custom Block. Structure of the block is documented in *[thesis.pdf](https://thekuko.github.io/namon/docs/thesis.pdf)* (Chapter 6).

### Features ###
- Works on Windows and Linux (FreeBSD and MacOS support will be added in the future)
- Uses **PCAPNG** so Wireshark can read the capture file as usual

### Dependencies ###
- Windows: Npcap/WinPcap
- Linux: libpcap

The application was tested on the following platforms:
- Windows:
    - Windows 10 (Npcap)
    - Windows 7 (WinPcap)
- Linux:
    - Ubuntu (15.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS)
    - lubuntu (17.04)
    - Debian (8 Jessie)
    - Kali (2016.1, 2016.2)

## Build
**Linux**    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheKuko/namon.git
cd namon
make
```

**Windows**
1. Clone https://github.com/TheKuko/namon.git
2. Download [npcap-sdk](https://nmap.org/npcap/) into _libs/_ folder, extract it and rename extracted folder to *npcap-sdk*
3. Build *win32/namon.sln* using Visual Studio

Final binary is located in **_bin/_** folder.

## Program arguments
```bash
namon [-v[<level>]] [-i <interface>] [-w <output_file>]
```

|Argument                                |Description                                                                                                                    |

|`-h`, `--help`                          |Show help message and exit.                                                                                                    |
|`-v`, `--verbosity`                     |Select verbosity level 0(_disabled_), 1(_error_), 2(_warning_), 3(_info_). If no value is specified `1` is used by default.    |
|`-i <interface>`, `--interface`         |Capturing interface. If the tool is run without this parameter, available interfaces will be printed.                          |
|`-w <output_file>`, `--output-file`     |Name of the output file. Default filename is `namon_capturedTraffic.pcapng`.                                                    |
